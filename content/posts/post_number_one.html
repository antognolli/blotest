This is an example post of using the blog template created based on my own
blog. It was created to make it easier to deploy other blogs or sites with
[nanoc] If i have the need of doing so.

And also some C code with neat syntax highlight:

<pre><code data-language="c">lwan_http_status_t
gif_beacon(lwan_request_t *request __attribute__((unused)),
           lwan_response_t *response,
           void *data __attribute__((unused)))
{
    /*
     * 1x1 transparent GIF image generated with tinygif
     * http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=7974
     */
    static char gif_beacon_data[] = {
        0x47, 0x49, 0x46, 0x38, 0x39, 0x61, 0x01, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x90,
        0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x21, 0xF9, 0x04,
        0x05, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x2C, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01,
        0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x02, 0x04, 0x01
    };

    response->mime_type = "image/gif";
    strbuf_set_static(response->buffer, gif_beacon_data, sizeof(gif_beacon_data));

    return HTTP_OK;
}
</code></pre>

It's still raw and can be improved, but already does its job as needed. If you
have comments or suggestions, just let me know. Some shell commands for good
measure:

<pre><code data-language="shell">$ cd /tmp
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=dummy bs=1M count=10
$ echo $?
0
</code></pre>
